    Scenario Outline: Happy Path - Post request to /answer Endpoint for nino <selectedNino> with >=3 questions over 2 questionKeys
        Given I send a new answer request to the core stub with nino value <selectedNino> for user <userId>
        Given I send a valid POST request with <contentType> and <accept> to the fetchQuestions endpoint with status code <statusCode>
        When I send a first GET request to the question endpoint followed by a POST request to the answer endpoint with the correct answerKey
        And I send a second GET request to the question endpoint followed by a POST request to the answer endpoint
        And I send a third GET request to the question endpoint followed by a POST request to the answer endpoint
        Then I should receive a valid response with statusCode <intermediateStatusCode> from the answers endpoint
        Then I should receive a final valid response with statusCode <finalStatusCode> from the questions endpoint
        And I should receive a VC with the correct values <verificationScore> for <selectedNino> with >=3 questions over 2 questionKey
        Examples:
            | contentType      | accept           | statusCode | intermediateStatusCode | finalStatusCode | selectedNino | verificationScore     | userId |
